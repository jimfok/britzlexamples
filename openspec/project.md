# Project Context

## Purpose
Showcase a curated, ready-to-run library of Defold game engine examples. Each example demonstrates a single mechanic, rendering trick, input pattern, or hosting setup, making it easy for developers to clone the repo, open an example in Defold, and learn by inspecting production-quality Lua scripts, assets, and build settings. The `docs/` site mirrors playable HTML5 builds so the same artifacts can be shared publicly through GitHub Pages.

## Tech Stack
- Defold Editor 2 and runtime (`game.project`, `.collection`, `.go`, `.gui` assets, Lua scripts, message-passing APIs)
- Lua 5.1 for gameplay scripting plus Defold built-in modules (`go`, `msg`, `gui`, `vmath`, `socket`, etc.)
- HTML5 builds generated by Defold (`dmloader.js`, `index.html`, `archive` data) to power the static demo site
- Lightweight static site stack (Skeleton + Normalize CSS, minimal vanilla JS) for listing and filtering demos under `docs/`

## Project Conventions

### Code Style
- Follow Defold's defaults: tab-indented Lua with compact functions, `local` scoped helpers at the top of the file, and snake_case file names (for example `coin_magnet.script`).
- Favor message-passing idioms (`msg.post`, `on_message`) and engine helpers (`go.animate`, `particlefx.play`, `factory.create`) over custom frameworks.
- Keep each example self-contained: scripts, GUI scenes, and data live under `examples/<example_name>/<example_name>/`.

### Architecture Patterns
- Every example is an independent Defold project with its own `game.project`, bootstrap collection, input bindings, and assets. Examples should never reference files from another example.
- Shared presentation assets (screenshots, GIFs, CSS) live under `images/` and `docs/css` so static hosting works without the editor.
- HTML5 exports for demos are stored under `docs/<example_name>/` using the default Defold bundler output (`archive/`, `dmloader.js`, splash image).

### Testing Strategy
- Validate behavior manually inside Defold Editor 2 using the "Build and Run" command for the target example.
- For features meant to run in browsers or touch devices, export to HTML5 and verify via the matching `docs/<example_name>/index.html`.
- When contributing, document expected input (keyboard, mouse, touch, gamepad) in the example README or script comments so reviewers know how to exercise it.

### Git Workflow
- Work off `master`; create feature branches or forks for new examples or fixes and submit pull requests.
- Limit each pull request to a single example or documentation change to keep diffs reviewable.
- Keep commits descriptive (`add-screen-shake-example`, `fix-gui-render-order-readme`) and mention any required external assets or steps in the PR description.

## Domain Context
- Defold is a cross-platform 2D/3D game engine. Examples span physics (Box2D), GUI layout, particle effects, networking (WebSocket, WebView), and HTML5 platform quirks.
- Many assets come from Kenney.nl and must retain attribution; custom graphics/screenshots live in `images/`.
- The `docs/index.html` landing page filters examples via CSS class tags, so new demos should include the right tags and thumbnails to stay discoverable.

## Important Constraints
- Keep examples lightweight (<~5MB) and dependency-free beyond the stock Defold runtime so they load quickly on GitHub Pages.
- Do not introduce shared code across examples; if reuse is unavoidable, duplicate the minimal files needed to keep each project portable.
- Maintain compatibility with the latest public Defold build; avoid using experimental engine extensions unless the example is specifically about that feature.
- Respect asset licensing (Kenney assets are CC0/MIT-friendly) and keep custom art/code under the MIT terms in `LICENSE`.

## External Dependencies
- Defold Editor 2 for editing/building, plus the underlying Lua runtime shipped with the engine.
- GitHub Pages (or any static host) that serves the `docs/` directory when publishing demos.
- Third-party presentation assets referenced by the docs site (Normalize.css, Skeleton) bundled under `docs/css`.
